![Platform: Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-Windows-0078D6)

A Windows receiver for RTL-SDR, LimeSDR Mini and Airspy R2, controlled from a web browser: up to four SDRs as four VFOs,
with a transceiver-style screen (S-meter, 7-segment displays, spectrum, waterfall, function keys) and built-in decoders.

## Installation

RADIMCOM comes as one Windows setup, **`RADIMCOM_Setup_v<version>.exe`** (about 65 MB), from
[Releases](https://github.com/om2amr/RADIMCOM/releases). Python and all its packages are inside it: there is nothing to
install first, nothing is downloaded, and no administrator rights are needed.

1. **Run the setup.** It installs to `C:\RADIMCOM` (or a folder you choose) in English, Slovak or Czech.
   Windows SmartScreen may warn about an unsigned program: *More info* → *Run anyway*.
2. **Tick what you need:** the USB driver for your SDR (Zadig for RTL-SDR and Airspy, FTDI D3XX for LimeSDR),
   DSD-FME for digital voice ([DSD](docs/decoders/dsd.md)), a desktop shortcut, start with Windows.
3. **SDR setup:** at the end the connected dongles appear as cards; drag each onto VFO A–D, set ppm and the HF
   upconverter if you use one, SAVE. Later it is in the tray menu and the Start menu (*RADIMCOM SDR setup*).
4. **RADIMCOM opens in its own window** with its icon on the taskbar (pin it there). Closing the window keeps the
   receiver running in the tray (decoders and recordings go on); *Exit RADIMCOM* in the tray menu, or the green LED
   of the logo (MAIN), switches it off. F11 toggles full screen.
   The page also works in any browser at **http://localhost:8434**, also from another PC on your network.

**System tray:** the RADIMCOM icon by the clock (under ˄ if Windows hides it; drag it out to keep it in view) stays
while the receiver runs, also with the window closed. Left click opens the window; right click has the menu:

| Menu item | What it does |
|---|---|
| Open RADIMCOM | brings the window up |
| Open in the web browser | the page in your default browser (http://localhost:8434) |
| Data folder | opens `data\` (settings, memories, logs, recordings) in Explorer |
| Server log | the log of the running server (`data\server_logs`), useful when something does not work |
| SDR setup… | the dongles → VFO A–D assignment; stops the receiver while it is open |
| Start / Stop / Restart server | Stop frees the dongles (e.g. for another program) and RADIMCOM.exe stays in the tray; its window then offers START SERVER |
| Exit RADIMCOM | stops the receivers gracefully and closes everything |

With *start with Windows* ticked in the setup, RADIMCOM starts in the tray after login, without opening the window.

**Upgrade:** nothing to sort out by hand. The RADIMCOM setup is also the upgrade: run the newer one into the same
folder and it takes care of the rest. Your memories, VFO settings, logs and recordings live in the `data\` folder,
which the setup never overwrites (DSD-FME stays too); only the program itself is replaced.
RADIMCOM checks GitHub for a newer release and shows it beside the version under the logo, with *DOWNLOAD SETUP*;
exit RADIMCOM (tray menu) before you run it.

**From 0.114 or older (ZIP installation):** the old version also reports the new release, but it cannot upgrade itself
any more (there is no upgrade ZIP); instead of *UPGRADE* it offers *RELEASE PAGE*. Download the setup there, close the
RADIMCOM console window and install into the old folder. The setup recognizes the ZIP installation and turns it into
the RADIMCOM app; `data\` stays.

**Uninstall:** Windows Settings › Apps › RADIMCOM (it asks whether to delete `data\` too).

More: [Installation](docs/installation.md) (drivers, RADIMCOM.exe, running from the git sources).

\* Tested with LimeSDR Mini v1.x.

Up to four SDRs at once, each assigned to a VFO by its serial number; one dongle can also serve several VFOs
([VFO chaining](docs/configuration.md#vfo-chaining-one-dongle-for-several-vfos)).

## Features

### Receiver

- **Up to four SDRs as four VFOs (A–D)**, or one dongle shared by several VFOs (chaining). → [Configuration](docs/configuration.md)
- **Modes** AM, FM, WFM (stereo + RDS), LSB, USB, CW, DAB and DSD, with notch, ALC, DNR (weak HF voices out of the noise), audio LPF / HPF and AFI (voice inversion). → [Function keys](docs/controls.md#function-keys)
- **Squelch with ASQ (auto squelch)**: the level follows the measured noise floor plus a margin; **CTCSS / DCS tone squelch** (TSQ-C / TSQ-D) in FM. → [AUDIO keys](docs/controls.md#function-keys)
- **AGC+**: tuner gain set from the A/D level, as high as possible without clipping. → [GAIN keys](docs/controls.md#function-keys)
- **ATU (autotune, experimental)**: a click on an AM signal moves the tuning onto its carrier, on an SSB signal it puts the signal edge on the red line. → [TUNE keys](docs/controls.md#function-keys)
- **Shortwave (HF)** through an upconverter, always showing the real frequency. → [HF upconverter](docs/hf-upconverter.md)
- **Digital-mode decoders:** FT8 (with a map of the stations heard), WEFAX, CW, RTTY (terminal with tuning indicators: crossed ellipses, mini waterfall, eye), SSTV, PACKET (AX.25 1200 / 9600 Bd, APRS with map) and POCSAG (pagers, 512 / 1200 / 2400 Bd, error correction). → [DECODE](docs/controls.md#function-keys) · [POCSAG](docs/decoders/pocsag.md)
- **CW skimmer:** up to 16 Morse stations decoded at once with soft decisions (Viterbi, beam search), the operator's timing learnt (bug, straight key, Farnsworth), calls in the spectrum. → [CW](docs/decoders/cw.md)
- **Aircraft data link:** ACARS and VDL2 with CPDLC and ADS-C decoded to plain text and a map of the aircraft, and **HFDL** on HF (2.9–22 MHz, all channels of a band at once). → [Aircraft](docs/decoders/aircraft.md) · [HFDL](docs/decoders/hfdl.md)
- **AIS** ships on 161.975 / 162.025 MHz (own decoder, both channels at once) with a map of ships, base stations and aids to navigation. → [AIS](docs/decoders/ais.md)

- **DAB / DAB+ radio**, **digital voice** (DMR, P25, D-Star, YSF, …; test version) and **ISM** 433 / 868 MHz devices (incl. Wireless M-Bus meters) with device cards, 24 h curves and a timeline. → [DAB](docs/decoders/dab.md) · [DSD](docs/decoders/dsd.md) · [ISM](docs/decoders/ism.md)
- **Satellite tracking:** passes, world map, Doppler correction and a K3NG rotor, no other program needed. → [Satellites](docs/satellites.md)
- **Rotor control map:** click a place or a memory channel with a location (LAT / LON) and the rotor turns there; channels shown by their MEMORIES groups; beam sector on the map turns with the antenna; page CONNECTION disconnects the SAT tracker, memory recall or the map from the rotor. → [Rotor control](docs/satellites.md#rotor-control-map)
- **Scanner** (SCAN tab): memories, a frequency range or the FM broadcast band (FM BCAST, centred on each station) (all 2280 airband 8.33 kHz channels in ~4 s per pass at 1.536 MS/s), all channels in the band of the dongle checked at once from the spectrum; own squelch / ASQ / priority per channel, SKIP, LOCKOUT, carrier lockout, activity log with WAV recordings, search & store, occupancy heatmap. → [SCAN](docs/controls.md#scan)
- **MP3 recording** (REC / REC SQ) with a RECORDINGS tab to play the files in the browser, daily decoder logs, **HTTP API**, optional **TX with LimeSDR**. → [Configuration](docs/configuration.md)

### User interface

- **Transceiver-style screen** in brushed black anodized aluminium (other skins: black or light aluminium, mahogany, RAL paint): S-meter, recessed displays, 3D keys; every VFO is one dark display window with all its state, side by side, each waterfall keeps running. → [Controls](docs/controls.md)

## Security

> [!WARNING]
> **Trusted network only, never expose RADIMCOM to the internet.** It has no login, and by default it listens on all
> network interfaces. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), which also explains how to report a vulnerability.

Transmitting (LimeSDR) is off by default and legal only with a valid licence, see [Transmitting](docs/configuration.md#transmitting-limesdr).
