# Features

## Receiver features

- **Up to four VFOs, A–D.** Each VFO has its own SDR (RTL-SDR, LimeSDR Mini or Airspy R2, selected by serial number)
  and its own settings.
- **VFO chaining:** one dongle can serve several VFOs, e.g. one dongle for VFO A–D, or two dongles with two VFOs
  each. A chained VFO listens anywhere inside the band its dongle receives and shows a green CHAIN flag
  (see [VFO chaining](configuration.md#vfo-chaining-one-dongle-for-several-vfos)).
- **Modes:** AM, FM, WFM, LSB, USB and CW with selectable filter width, DAB (digital radio) and DSD (digital voice), each of these two with its own tab (see below).
- **WFM stereo** (19 kHz pilot, **ST** indicator) and **RDS**: station name (PS), RadioText, PI, PTY, TP/TA and clock (CT).
- **Squelch** for AM, FM and WFM, each mode with its own level. It decides every ~8 ms, so it does not cut off
  the start of a transmission (airband), and closes about 25 ms after the signal drops below the level. The level is marked on the S-meter with a yellow tick.
  - **ASQ (auto squelch):** the squelch level follows the noise in the channel plus a margin (6 dB by default, 2–30 dB in SET, AUDIO tab).
    The noise is measured in the spectrum of the dongle band, so a signal in the channel, even a long one, does not raise the level and close it.
    See [Function keys → AUDIO](controls.md#function-keys).
  - **Tone squelch TSQ-C (CTCSS) and TSQ-D (DCS)** in FM, in addition to the squelch level or ASQ: the audio passes only while the set
    sub-audio tone (50 standard tones 67.0–254.1 Hz) or DCS code (104 standard codes, N / I) is received; the tone is filtered out of what you hear.
    Shown in the VFO window under the frequency. See [Function keys → AUDIO](controls.md#function-keys).
- **AGC+ (smart gain):** sets the tuner gain from the level of the A/D converter, as high as possible without clipping it,
  also with strong signals outside the channel; presets CAREFUL / MODERATE (default) / BOLD trade clipping for a few dB more gain. With the squelch set, AGC+ switches it to auto squelch. See [Function keys → GAIN](controls.md#function-keys).
- **ATU (autotune), experimental,** in USB, LSB and AM: a click on a signal moves the tuning onto its carrier (AM within a few Hz in under 1 s);
  in SSB the edge of the voice band goes onto the red line (USB lower edge, LSB upper edge, ~2 s). See [Function keys → TUNE](controls.md#function-keys).
- **Audio processing:** automatic notch filter (NF), audio low-pass and high-pass filters (LPF / HPF), automatic audio level (ALC) with smooth gain, and **DNR** – weak HF voices out of the noise: an expander with a voice detector turns the noise between words down while the speech stays at full level (AUTO sets it by itself), plus a soft limiter.
- **AFI (audio frequency inversion):** voice inversion scrambler / descrambler, inversion frequency 500–4000 Hz; REC and the decoders get the descrambled audio.
  See [Function keys → AUDIO](controls.md#function-keys).
- **Remove DC peak** and **remove spurs** from local sources, in the waterfall and in the received signal.
- **Upconverter:** HF is tuned via the LO (e.g. 100 MHz), see [Shortwave (HF) reception](hf-upconverter.md). For a VFO with a manual converter switch, crossing
  30 MHz shows a warning whether the converter must be switched on (CONV) or set to BYPASS.
- **Decoders:** 11 decoders, see [Decoders](#decoders) below.
- **Satellite tracking:** pass prediction, world map, Doppler correction of the VFO and a K3NG antenna rotor over USB, planned for passes across the north; no other program needed. See [Satellite tracking](satellites.md).
- **ROTOR CONTROL tab (RCTRL key):** a map where a click (or a click on a channel of MEMORIES with a location) turns the rotor to that azimuth from the QTH, with the wanted azimuth (dashed line) and the antenna now (beam sector turning with the rotor), from any VFO; recalling a channel with a location opens the tab and turns the rotor to it; the channels are shown by their groups (a checkbox per group beside the map); page **CONNECTION** connects / disconnects the three sources of the wanted AZ / EL (SAT TRACKER, MEMORY RECALL, RCTRL MAP) from the rotor in a block diagram (rotor block green = at least one connected). See [Rotor control map](satellites.md#rotor-control-map).
- **REC and REC SQ:** record the audio of the selected VFO to MP3 files in `data\recordings` or an own folder (SETTINGS › GENERAL › RECORDINGS): everything, or only while the squelch is open.
- **SCAN tab (SCAN key, MENU group): scanner** on one VFO. Every ~85 ms it measures all channels in the band of the dongle at once
  from the spectrum, the tuner moves only between windows; memories (ALL / FAVOURITES / group), a RANGE (FROM / TO / STEP / MODE / BW, presets
  such as airband 8.33 kHz) the spectrum shown (VIEW) or the FM broadcast band (FM BCAST: 88–108 MHz, lands on the centre of each station, RDS PS as the name); START / PAUSE / SKIP / LOCKOUT / ◀ ▶ / STOP; own squelch, own ASQ margin and priority
  per memory (ASQ FOR ALL by default); resume DELAY / CARRIER / TIME; priority look into other windows, carrier lockout; activity LOG (CSV),
  WAV recording of each activity, search & store into a memory group, HEATMAP of the occupancy. See [MENU → SCAN](controls.md#scan).
- **RECORDINGS tab (RECS key):** the recorded files in a table (start, memory, frequency, mode, length, size), played in the browser; NEXT plays the next older file, filter, delete. See [RECS](controls.md#function-keys).
- **Daily logs:** the LOG checkbox in each decoder card writes to `data\logs\<decoder>_YYYY-MM-DD.txt` (UTC, one line per message; WEFAX/SSTV log the names of saved images), classic ACARS to `data\acars\acars_YYYY-MM-DD.txt` and VDL2 to `data\acars\vdl2_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`.
- **TX with LimeSDR** (optional, off by default), see [Transmitting (LimeSDR)](configuration.md#transmitting-limesdr).
- **HTTP API:** everything the page does can be done from scripts, see [API/API.md](../API/API.md).
- **Windows setup and app:** `RADIMCOM_Setup_v<version>.exe` installs RADIMCOM with its own Python (no admin rights, no internet), the USB drivers and DSD-FME as options, and upgrades an installation in place (`data\` stays). **RADIMCOM.exe** shows the page in its own window with the RADIMCOM icon (pinnable to the taskbar) and keeps the server in the tray when the window closes; full screen (F11) and MAIN power switch in the green LED of the logo; the SDR setup (dongles → VFO A–D, serial numbers, IDENTIFY by unplugging) in the same window. See [Installation](installation.md).
- **New version notice:** after each start RADIMCOM checks GitHub for a newer version and shows it with a link to its setup; run the setup into the same folder, `data\` and the settings stay. A red RADIMCOM logo shows that a newer version is available; a click on it opens the release page.
  See [Data folder](development.md#data-folder-data).

## UI features

- **Transceiver-style screen:** 7-segment frequency displays, function keys and band buttons (the **BAND** key hides the row of band buttons).
- **Skins** (SET → SKINS): dark, black or light brushed aluminium, mahogany, or a panel sprayed in a RAL colour (or any colour). See [SET](controls.md).
- **S-meter in seven layouts** (amber needle by default, needle, bar graph, LED bar, VFD display, 7-segment, peak bar), with the squelch level marked.
  Under it small bars show the CPU load and memory use of the PC.
- **All VFOs side by side:** the active VFO is lit, inactive ones are grey
  but show the actual tuned frequency. The waterfall of every VFO keeps running, so its history is visible
  right after switching. With fewer than four SDRs the remaining VFO windows stay in place, greyed out ("NO SDR").
- **Each VFO is one dark display window:** on top the name of the memory on its frequency, otherwise the band plan label
  (e.g. `HAM 70cm`) or the satellite transponder, lit on the active VFO (a memory name in its own tag colour); the receiver state, recording and mute indicators;
  the frequency; an info row (RX/TX, filter width, HPF and LPF with cutoffs, ST, SQL, CONV/BYPASS); a tone squelch row (CTCSS / DCS); annunciators lit like LCD segments (mode, AGC / AGC+, NF, SP, ALC, AFI, ASQ, ATU, satellite Doppler, CUE);
  **RF and SQL segment bars** (drag, click or mouse wheel; at a manual RF gain the RF bar and its value turn red while the A/D converter clips). See [VFO window](controls.md#vfo-window).
- **Spectrum and waterfall** with 1×–64× zoom (the waterfall keeps the history of the whole band, so after zooming out the hidden parts are shown at once) and a waterfall speed bar (1/8 – 4×) and waterfall settings under a gear (colour scheme, range, offset), the same gear and bar by the spectrum (zero level −20 … +20 dB, colour schemes background / curve); tuning by a click, dragging the band or the passband, the mouse wheel or the wheel over a digit of the display. See [Tuning](controls.md#tuning).
- **Band plan on the frequency axis** (Europe / ITU Region 1: ham, broadcast, aviation, marine, satellites, mobile networks, ISM…); hover it for the descriptions of all bands at that frequency.
- **Audio spectrum bubble:** hovering over the passband label shows the audio spectrum of the active VFO (in WFM the MPX signal with the stereo pilot, in CW also the decoded text).
- **Frequency memories** (MEMORIES tab) with groups, favourites, import from SDR# (`frequencies.xml`), JSON and CSV, export to JSON and CSV; memories in view show as tags in the spectrum,
  ↑ ↓ arrow keys recall the next one. A memory can also be a DAB channel (mode DAB) or a DSD (digital voice) channel.
- **Memory editor** (pages of the MEMORIES tab; by Brano, [brjanicek](https://github.com/brjanicek)): channels in several groups, with a decoder and a recording (REC, REC SQ or REC SQ with ASQ) started at recall, a note and their own tag colour
  (or no tag); groups with notes (add, rename, copy, merge, delete); duplicates shown; import from SDR#, JSON or CSV and export to
  JSON or CSV, both through a list to edit and choose from first. See [Memory editor](controls.md#memory-editor).
- **Audio** starts automatically when the page opens and comes from the active VFO.
- **CUE:** keep listening to other VFOs at a separate CUE level while one VFO is selected;
  MAIN and CUE volume faders with a dB scale, stereo level meter with peak hold and CLIP LEDs, MUTE.
- **DECODERS tab** with a page for each decoder, and the **SATELLITES** tab (also the **SAT** key), which shows the active linear, FM, image and other satellites from AMSAT, with clickable links.
- **AD (additional display)** under the S-meter: error messages (red, accepted by OK, the frame blinks), the rotor AZ / EL (MONITOR), DAB now on air (station, SNR, running DLS text) or RDS, by this priority.
- **Rotor page** in SETTINGS › GENERAL: one rotor for the whole station (not tied to a VFO, settings in `data\rotor.json`), ON / OFF, polar plot and elevation column 0–180° with the antenna and its target, a click moves the antenna; STOP, RESET, MONITOR.
- **SETTINGS tab** (gear key) split into **GENERAL** (the whole station: SKINS, S-METER, TOUCHPAD, LOCATION – station locator or latitude / longitude, also chosen on a map, used by the satellites, packet, HFDL and AIS; ROTOR) and **VFO** (keys VFO-A … VFO-D on the left, the lit one joined to its card: SDR DONGLE with a block diagram of the receive chain, ADVANCED with the list of dongles and their VFOs, SP, AGC+ and the S9 calibration, AUDIO, TX); **MEMORIES tab** (MEM key) with the pages CHANNELS (also the list to recall from), GROUPS, IMPORT, EXPORT.
- **Clock** in local time or UTC (a click switches), with the date under it.
- **The page scales with the browser window** (laid out for at least 1920 × 820 px), so the layout does not reflow in small windows.
