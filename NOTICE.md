## Radio transmission notice

The Software can control radio transmitting hardware. Transmitting is legal only for a holder of a valid licence or
other authorisation required in the country of operation, within its privileges and the applicable regulations (ITU,
CEPT, FCC or the national authority). The operator is fully and solely responsible for every transmission and its
consequences. Anyone who modifies or removes the transmit frequency limits of the Software is solely responsible for
any transmission outside the bands they are licensed for.

## Third-party components

The code of RADIMCOM itself is under the MIT License. The components below keep their own licences. The git repository
does not contain the binaries; the release packages do, except where noted.

### Not in the package: DSD-FME

The DSD mode uses [DSD-FME](https://github.com/lwvmobile/dsd-fme) (ISC, parts GPL v2; see `COPYRIGHT` there) as a separate
program. It is **not distributed with RADIMCOM**; `install_dsd.bat` downloads the release of its author into `lib\dsd-fme` at
the user's own decision. DSD-FME contains [mbelib](https://github.com/szechyjs/mbelib), an implementation of the AMBE+2 and IMBE
voice codecs. According to the mbelib notice, its functions may be covered by patents owned by Digital Voice Systems, Inc., and compiling or using it
may infringe patent rights in your jurisdiction and/or require a licence. Check this for your country before installing it.

### Source code

Each release from Ver. 0.108 has `RADIMCOM_sources_v<version>.zip` with the source code of the GPL and LGPL components
in that release, in the exact versions used, and the build instructions (`installer/VDL2.txt`, `installer/DAB.txt`,
`installer/build_dab.sh`, `installer/welle_radimcom.patch`). The list of its contents is `SOURCES.txt` in that zip. It is built by
`installer/make_sources.py`.

**librtlsdr:** the exact source of the `librtlsdr.dll` in the packages is still being confirmed, so it is not in that
zip yet. To ask for it, or for any other source code, write to radim.mutina@gmail.com.

### Data

- The VDL2 ground station list (`VDL2_Ground_Stations.txt`) comes from <https://acars-vdl2.groups.io/>, redistributed
  with approval.
- The airport tables in `airports.py` come from OurAirports (public domain).
- The SATELLITES tab shows pages of AMSAT (<https://www.amsat.org/>), downloaded by the running program. They belong to AMSAT and are not in the repository or the release packages.
- The orbital elements for pass prediction (TLE, amateur group) come from CelesTrak (<https://celestrak.org/>), downloaded by the running program once a day into `data\sat_tle.txt`; they are not in the repository or the release packages.
- The list of satellite transmitters (SATELLITES tab, TRACK) comes from SatNOGS DB (<https://db.satnogs.org/>, Libre Space Foundation; data under CC BY-SA 4.0), downloaded by the running program once a week into `data\sat_transmitters.json`; it is not in the repository or the release packages.
- The map for choosing the station place (SATELLITES tab, SETUP, CHOOSE ON MAP) shows tiles of OpenStreetMap (<https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright>), © OpenStreetMap contributors, loaded by the browser from tile.openstreetmap.org only while that map is open; nothing of it is in the package.
